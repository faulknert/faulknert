## Summary

Provide a summary of the positive and negative aspects of the outline draft you have reviewed. Specify any places in the reviewed outline where you did not understand the point, or needed more information, or where something did not seem to belong in the outline of the proposal. You have to write at least five sentences in this paragraph.

Overall the outline is a good start since he has the two chapters he will be completing before the end of semester completed in the proper outline format highlighted in the email. Also in his repo he currently has updated his title and it seems to capture what his thesis is about while using descriptive words. In his first chapter he choose introduction, which has a good start to outlining all the things he will be putting into his introduction. The sections clearly state a point and then he describes the point in the bullets below. The next section he choose was related works and in this section he currently has a few articles and states how they relate to his work and how he will be using them. I think he can improve his outlines by going into more depth in each section because right now they are very basic and it will be hard to write a few pages on the 2 articles he currently has listed in his related works section. The outlines currently available on his repo are a good start but more information will be needed when the actual writing is due.
