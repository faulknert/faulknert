### Summary

Currently I have been waiting to see Robert Samuels' outline for his methods section but he has not pushed anything up or told me that he has done this assignment yet. After waiting for the section I think he needs to plan out his methods section and make his outline because I know he has parts of his coding done so he should be able to easily finish his outline. I have no positives to make because he has not done anything yet and the only negative is that he needs to start and finish this section as he has no work completed.
