## Summary

Overall, this individual needs to work on both sections of the two chapters. Both chapters do not meet the necessary length requirements. Furthermore, only the intro has an actual body paragraph, while the related works doesn't have any sections completed yet. There is no thesis and most of these points have not been hit on this peer review. There is much needed work for these two chapters before the final due date next Tuesday.
