## Summary

Overall Robert has an okay methods section currently. It clearly states what he is doing and how is completing that task. Also currently the writing shows the tools he is using in his comp. I think one big thing Robert needs to work on is his detail of his algorithms. I also think that he should add in more technical diagrams to help explain the flow of his work and the different parts of the code. Overall I think if the chapter got some more work done onto it, it would be ready to be put into a paper.
