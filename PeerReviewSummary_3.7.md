### Summary

Overall The outline that Robert Samuel has shown me has a good start to it. I think his ideas of supporting evidence can be developed further throughout the outline. He has a good introduction writing and his ideas are well thought out. The work seems to have a logical flow and the order of the work seems good. I think more supporting arguments are needed under his points but other than that it is a good start.
