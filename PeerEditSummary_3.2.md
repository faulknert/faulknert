## Summary

Provide a summary of the positive and negative aspects of the proposal draft you have reviewed. Specify any places in the reviewed proposal where you did not understand the point, or needed more information, or where something did not seem to belong in the proposal. You have to write at least five sentences in this paragraph.

Overall the proposal has a good start to it, the title seems appropriate to the research and work the Robert will be doing. Next I think that your abstract is one of the strongest section in your proposal and does a good job introducing the topic you are going to be doing your research on. Your introduction states what you want to do and why but does not use research and references in order to fulfill this task. The related works, conclusion and bibliography have not been done yet, and will need work to be done immediately. The method section has a good start to it but could use more tools you will be using and exactly how you will be using them, such as software and how it will be used. Overall the method section needs more description on how each program will be used. The schedule is a good start but is not detailed enough to go into next semester and when things will be done. The evaluation section also needs more in depth because right now there is only 2 tools that you are using in this section. The conclusion is currently empty but I understand as it is hard to sum everything up if you are not done. Finally this paper needs more references, pages, and visual aids. Also the bibliography is currently empty, I know you have been using sources so just add them as you keep using them.
